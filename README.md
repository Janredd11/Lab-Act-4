# assign_grade
I created a function called assign_grade(score) that converts the input to an integer and checks whether it falls within the valid range of 0 to 100. Using conditional statements, the function assigns grades based on the score range and displays error messages for invalid inputs. I also tested the function with various inputs and included an interactive option for users to enter their scores for grading.
